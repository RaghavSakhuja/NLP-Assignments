i am feeling much like the guy in the pic above a little overwhelmed and starved for time but very delighted to be making new work and preparing my little florida bungalow for thanksgiving guests this weekend
i feel very weird about so much of my psychological safety coming from noah providing money
i feel amazed how this sh it things happened to me
im feeling really weird
i felt fine when we got there but after a short while i started feeling really funny
im getting there but i really do feel dazed and confused at the moment
i love seeing what books resonate with my girls i love seeing their faces grow serious when characters face complications trials and obstacles and i love the discussions that come out of reading time as we talk about main ideas how the books made us feel and what may have surprised us
i read through the ol feefyefo space i feel amazed at how much i could blabber and how transparent i was with my life
i feel shocked that my photo was chosen as the best photo of the week
i feel like i need to emphasize that because i was very impressed with the color of it
i could feel myself hit this strange foggy wall
i was supposed to be working on a grant application but feeling overwhelmed i decided to curl up with my computer and netflix
i remember feeling shocked that he had called me religious
i will tell ya i have been following a very norma inspired diet for a week tomorrow and i feel amazing
i feel so amazed seeing chiangmai
i feel like when i left scad i was finally coming into my own and making work that impressed people
i feel like itd be strange at the least and possibly offensive to tell a gay friend id like to experiment or something like that
i am feeling quite overwhelmed
i loved the feeling i got during an amazing slalom run whether it was in training or in a race
